# CodeRed-ImGui
Partial source of the ImGui interfaces used in the Rocket League version of CodeRed.

# About
This repo is just part of the ImGui sourced used in CodeRed, you cannot just copy and paste it into your project and expect it to work. Treat it as an extension of the "imgui_demo.cpp" file I guess, feel free to use anything from this in your own projects.
