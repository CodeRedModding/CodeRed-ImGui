# CodeRed-ImGui
Raw source of some of the ImGui interfaces used in the Rocket League version of CodeRed.

# About
This repo is just part of the ImGui source used in CodeRed, it is largely depending on my own project so you cannot just copy and paste code for code and expect it to work. I just wanted to get the actual source of the interfaces out so people can see how they worked; I do plan to organize it in the future. As of now treat this as an extension of the "imgui_demo.cpp" file I guess, feel free to use anything from this repo in your own projects as the license is under MIT.
